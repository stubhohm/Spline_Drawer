This is a supplimental program for developing in 2d engines for drawing splines and bezier curves.
Hot keys are displayed on screen during use. 
To add a new curve segment you need to click on the tail end of a current segment.
If you have an issue selecting something try clicking anywhere empty to reset the cursor. This usually solves the issue, but it is a known bug that I will work out.
