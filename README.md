This is a supplimental program for developing in 2d engines for drawing splines and bezier curves.
Hot keys are displayed on screen during use. 
To add a new curve segment you need to click on the tail end of a current segment while in the "add" edit mode.
If you have an issue selecting something try clicking anywhere empty to reset the cursor. This usually solves the issue, but it is a known bug that I will look into. 
Other than that lone bug. The program does what I need it to do, and prints either relative or absolute point values to the terminal to be used in other projects. 
I may revisit it and add more features, like ability to change colors or change the steps taken in any given spline segment etc. 
The deletion feature currently does nothing, but I could just ignore an excess tail segment from the printed data value since it is not getting directly ported in from one program to the other.
